.\" The reason I applied to this school was that it was in the town where I
.\" had born, which meant I could live in my parents place while going to
.\" school.

.\" Effectively the commercial school was a bit of disaster.  There were some
.\" courses I did not pass, and I did not bother to thinking about them too
.\" much.  But the school had lots of PC's and the internet!  Meanwhile I got
.\" from my brother his old PC to which I installed linux (slackware, kernel
.\" 1.2.13).  While others read how to do accounting I tried to understand C,
.\" no wonder at the end I technically failed.
