.SS progps-ng
It was ages ago when I sent a patch to procps to add \-\-human readable
option to
.IR free (1)
command.  The upstream was dead, and nothing happen.  Then I noticed
RedHat, Suse, and Debian had forked procps, so I sent the patch to them
and it was accepted in April 2011.

By summer 2012 I had done about two hundred changes to project, that
fixed
.IR "build system" ,
unified
.IR "coding style" ,
added
.I long options
to commands,
made
.I manual pages
clean, enhanced
.IR "error printing" ,
made
.I NLS
to work and so on.  At this point the libproc was known to be next thing
requiring a lot of changed, but the project seemed to lack an idea how to
do that.  Meanwhile I end up doing some other contributions, and the
procps-ng eventually was out of my radar.
