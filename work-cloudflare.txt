.SS Cloudflare \- July 2015 onwards.
Couple months after lastminute.com was bought writing was on the wall, I had
to move on.
.I London
at this point still felt like a reasonable place to live, so I decided to
find something else from the same town.  While looking Cloudflare got my
attention as a company that is using
.IR golang ,
so I decided to send a CV to them and see if I could get a programmer
position.  That did not turn out to happen, but I got
.I systems reliability engineer (SRE)
position.

When I joined Cloudflare it was already ridiculously large installation, by
what I mean it handled more requests and traffic I've ever seen.  There were
tens of co-locations where computers were serving many hundreds of gigabytes
of traffic.  As an SRE my duties has included
.IR "on-call shifts" ,
.IR "attack mitigation" ,
.I salt stack
configuration management, and
.I release engineer
work.  Due the sheer number of releases I have taken care of I was asked to
formalise
.IR "release process" .
The tools that have become my bread and butter in Cloudflare are
.IR Grafana ,
and
.I Prometheus
monitoring.

After working as SRE few years I got finally a change to become professional
programmer.  This is when I joined
.I DNS Team
and started programming in
.I golang
on daily basis.  My contributions in the team have been mostly about
authoritative DNS, and especially
.IR "DNS routing" .
This work has given me change to being programmer in
.I "distributed computing"
environment that is highly
.IR concurrent .
