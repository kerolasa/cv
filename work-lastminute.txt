.SS lastminute.com \- September 2012 to June 2015.
The Netherlands started to feel like a place I've seen.  For whole of my
life I've been moving from smaller places to bigger, and found them more
interesting than the previous.  With that in mind it really should not be
great surprise I went to
.IR London .
.PP
When I search a job from London I was open to any reasonably sounding
company, and lastminute.com found me.  In the lastminute.com I have
duties from typical
.I senior system administrator
tasks to an
.I architect
type
.IR role .
.PP
At the time when I joined
.I puppet
management was still new for the
company.  Now the existing systems has been either reinstalled or retro
fitted to use puppet,
.IR foreman ,
.IR pulp ,
and some systems even do continuous
deployments.  Needless to say cleaning up a decade of legacy is a big on
going job, with a twist that once something starts to work one finds more
broken items to fix.
.PP
The introduction and proper use of configuration management, and advanced
facilities for developers such as
.IR "jenkins pipelines" ,
has made it clear there is lots of room for improvements.  The areas
where improvements are mostly needed are
.IR monitoring ,
.IR "inventory maintenance" ,
.IR "account management" ,
and
.IR orchestration .
.PP
Due my experience in open source my managers has asked me to drive many
of the improvement efforts in
.IR "systems designer role" .
That has lead my work time to be split in three more or less equal effort
categories;
.I keep
the other system admins and developers in
.I align
with
.IR "long term goals" ,
try and document
.IR "new stuff" ,
take a part of
.I problem solving
when old system has
.IR "big impact issues" .
Basically I am halftime tech coach part time developer researcher
fireman.
.PP
The lastminute.com job has made me to learn a lot of new stuff.  The
existing puppet skills has been updated to whole new level.  I had to
learn some
.IR ruby ,
and relearn
.I subversion
in ninja level.  This is also the first time when I am so aware of
.IR "PCI compliance" .
.PP
One of the new aspects in this job for me is dealing members of the team
in India and Texas.  Having
.I team so far apart
in timezone wise is not easy, but there is no other option than deal the
situation and be as
.I clear
in
.I communications
as possible.
.PP
My final deliverable at lastminute.com end up being a technical plan to
migrate data centre migration from US to Europe, with emphasis on infra
structure services, such as provisioning and configuration management.
Luckily by the time planning took place the puppet master was already using
.I gitlab
and
.I r10k
so that managing complex view of data was at leas possible if not easy.
