.SS f5gs
The
.I f5gs
has similar history as
.IR dhcpd-pools .
A company I am working in,
.IR lastminute.com ,
had a problem, and I chose to fix the issue with a piece of software. 
The technical problem again is pretty simple.  It would be nice to
control whether a load balancer,
.IR "F5 BigIP" ,
is sending traffic to a destination with a tool that is in destination. 
Or to say the same in different way; how can I
.I declare
a server to be in
.I maintenance state
without logging in to various web interfaces here and there.
.PP
The f5gs is a
.I daemon
that answers to
.I socket
telling a
.I state
that was declared by human being.  The socket can answer finite number of
states, which means they can be expected, and one can make F5 to use this
daemon as
.IR "health check"  .
Tool also allows run of state change scripts, that will perform tasks
.I managed with puppet
and relevant for the system.  An example of such is supression of
.I alarming
when maintenance is declared.
.PP
This command is still very new, and it is difficult to tell if the tool
ever gets any popularity in greater audience.
