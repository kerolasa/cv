.SS TeliaSonera \- April 2000 to December 2006.
Sales support was not really my thing, so I started to look for more
.I proper system administration
jobs.
.\"  Now thinking I were incredibly lucky that the bubble years where
.\" going on.  Otherwise changes of getting hired as a self learned computer
.\" hacker would have been pretty bleak.
The company who took a change with me was
.IR TeliaSonera .
This is the point in time when I consider my professional system
administration career to begin.  The first three or four years I was a
.IR "web portal administrator" .
In the early days portal was made of
.IR "Vignette V4" ,
that I upgraded to
.IR V5 .
Loadbalancing was done with
.IR "Alteon switches" ,
that were there before my time.  Later on the portal got
.I Bluecoat
reverse
proxies were used for http acceleration, user authentication was moved
from content database to
.IR "Sun Directory LDAP" ,
along with various other enhancements that most people consider now a
days as standard web building blocks.  For me it was great to be part of
team that was among first ones in the Finland to do this sort of stuff.

When I moved from Tampere to Helsinki I got a change to become a
.I DNS hostmaster team
technical lead.  My duty was to
.IR maintain ,
.I upgrade
and finally
.I redesign a
.I DNS platform
containing 20.000 domains and about 1 gigabytes of recursion traffic per
hour.  I also took care of answering to hostmaster requests that required
in depth
.I RFC
knowledge.  These DNS systems ran on
.IR Linux , and had
.I F5 BigIP
load balancing.
