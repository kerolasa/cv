.SS dhcpd-pools
The
.I dhcpd-pools
was my first real open source effort.  In
.I TeliaSonera
we had a problem of having rather large dhcpd setup.  Monitoring the state
of leases was about taking nearly as long as polling interval.  I decided to
solve the problem.  First implementation was an
.I awk
script that proved the algorithm worked.  The second version was wrote in
.IR C .
After getting all working I decided to publish the code using open source
licence.  I have been maintainer of this tool since 2006.  The dhcpd-pools
has been really great project for me, and lead to know how to use
.I automake
and
.IR autoconf ,
static analyzers such as
.I gcc
with all warnings,
.IR clang ,
.IR smatch ,
and
.IR cppcheck .
The numerous times I've caused a crash has teach me usefulness of
.IR gdb ,
and
.IR valgrind .
For performance tuning I first used gcc
.RI profiling ,
before learning how to use
.I perf
tool.  And obviously version control systems has been in use since early
days, first
.I cvs
later
.IR git .
