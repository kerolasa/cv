.SS dhcpd-pools
The
.I dhcpd-pools
was my first real open source effort.  In
.I TeliaSonera
we had a problem of having rather large dhcpd setup.  Monitoring the
state of leases was about taking nearly as long as polling interval.  I
decided to solve the problem.  First implementation was
.I awk
script that proved the algorithm I chose worked, and the second version
was wrote in
.IR C .
When the analysis program ran as expected I decided to publish the work.

I have been maintaining this tool since 2006.  The dhcpd-pools has been
really great project for me.  I have learned how to use
.I automake
and
.IR autoconf ,
static analyzers such as
.I gcc
with all warnings,
.IR cmake ,
.IR smatch ,
and
.IR cppcheck .
The numerous times I've caused a crash has teach me
usefulness of
.IR gdb ,
and
.IR valgrind .
For performance tuning I first used
gcc
.RI profiling ,
before learning how to use
.I perf
tool.  And obviously
version control systems has been in use since early days, first
.I cvs
then
.IR git .
