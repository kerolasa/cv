.SS "Further Qualification in Information Technology"
2004-09-15 - 2006-02-09 Amiedu
.\" The decision to get job qualification from Amiedu was given my friend
.\" Tuomas who did similar study.  Point simply was, and is, that since
.\" neither of us were nothing more than self learned hackers we had an issue
.\" to apply any official job positions, for example working for government.
.\" Since these studies where practically free, and could be made as evening
.\" course I thought it is better to have some official paper telling I'm
.\" some good than nothing.
.\"
.\" == The official text, I stole the last chapter ==
.\" The compulsory module of the qualification is information technology in
