.\" Quite frankly I am terrible what comes to human languages.  I blame my
.\" attitude, for me it's good enough if I am roughly understood.  Minding
.\" too much about grammary would probably stop me saying anything, and that
.\" is not good either.  What ever you do please do not consider my services
.\" in literature would be worth while investing a penny.

.\" That said I claim being very active ticket comment writer, documentation
.\" updater, and excellent in making diagrams, idea illustrations, and
.\" statistical analysis in graphical format.  Some even say I am the most
.\" talkative Finn they have ever met.  So I do like communication, it's just
.\" the mistakes that I don't care too much.
.\"
.\" BTW the note in Swedish relates to Finnish regulations.  Every Finn must
.\" learn Swedish to some basic level.  Most accomplishes to do that to a
.\" level of passing the studies, and then after not using the language for
.\" so many years there is not much left of it.  Ask any Finn, that is a
.\" pretty common story with our Swedish skill.
