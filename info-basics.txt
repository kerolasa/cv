.\" Agreed, the military rank is a bit strange thing to have in CV.  Reason
.\" why I mention it is quite simple.  In Finland there is a mandatory army,
.\" and it quite common in that country to mention your rank.  Notice that my
.\" rank is tiny bit better than just a common soldier which means they
.\" appriciated my service.

.\" Talking about service in army my position was in an office doing
.\" paperwork for the squad, and it happen to be that my fairly good in
.\" typing that made me the most productive office soldier they had seen for
.\" years.  That probably was reason why I got +1 to my rank.
