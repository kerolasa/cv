.SS Capgemini Finland \- January 2007 to August 2008.
After the telco experience I went to
.I Capgemini
to checkout how it feels to be a consultant.
.PP
I was tasked to be
.I principal engineer
in implementing retail company
.IR "order process systems" .
At that time the system handled orders worth of
.IR "billion euros per year" .
When the retail system was done my second task in Capgemini was an
internal
.I DNS architecture
for
.I "Nokia Siemens Networks" .
The goal to make ridiculously highly reliable system, so I told them how
to make
.I anycast
DNS to work.
.PP
While being tasked with fairly interesting client jobs I also took part
in
.IR "on-call rota" ,
and participated in normal system administration activities for various
big and small customers.  That familiarized me with
.I AIX
on
.IR "IBM z-series" ,
.I HP-UX
of all sorts using hardware from blades
to
.IR superdome .
I also got familiar with
.IR "Sun Cluster ,
.I HPUX Serviceguard
and
.IR HACMP
on AIX.  The
.I Oracle RAC
setup in HP-UX environment using disks
from
.I HP EVA
with
.IR multipathing ,
that where bound to gether with
.I volume groups
and
.I logical volumes
made me first pull my hair off, but now when I think the stuff the
experience really thought me how to deal
.IR "block devices" .
Perhaps I should be happy that I needed to take care of that mess as
well.
