I have spent with this project more time than with any other project.  The
first change I wrote is from October 2010.  By now I have done more than
1800 changes.

Being member of this project has changed a lot how I think about computers,
programming, and co-operating with community.  I have even caused a
CVE-2015-5224, and fixed one CVE-2015-5218.
