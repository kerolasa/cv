.SS TomTom \- September 2008 to August 2012.
I always knew I wanted to go abroad.  It took me nearly a year to find a
position that would work for both me and employer, and all matched with
TomTom.
.PP
When working in TomTom my primary job is to maintain
.UR http://routes.tomtom.com/
.UE
site.  The job included
.I change management
from test to production,
.IR "developer support" ,
being
.IR "third line customer support" ,
setting up
.I monitoring
and looking after
.I security
and
.IR "performance metrics" .
This role included a lot of interaction with different developer teams,
who made the web map and traffic information systems.  Without knowing I
was doing
.IR devops .
.PP
But being part of devops did not mean I could stop support activities in
an
.IR "on-call rota" ,
or being part of various small Techops organisation
.IR projects .
Such projects included two
.IR "data center moves" ,
taking
.I puppet
into use, reconstruction all
.IR documentation ,
and organisational stream lining that happen in form of tearing down lots
of red tape.  I also did reimplementation of all
.I DNS
management and server setup.
.PP
In TomTom almost all systems are
.IR Linuxes ,
network equipment
.I Cisco
and storage
.IR NetApp .
In TomTom nearly all applications are run in
java
containers, which are 60%
.IR jboss ,
30%
.I tomcat
and rest are various such as
.I daemons
wrote in
.IR C .
In this company I got to be very familiar with
.I Confluence
and
.IR Jira .
