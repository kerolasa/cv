.SS "Novo Group" \- February 1999 to June 1999.
.\" I came back to normal life from army just before new year 1999, and I
.\" decided to idle as long as I feel.  Three weeks later I found myself
.\" working with Finnish government funding in a local system administration
.\" company as trainee.
In
.I Novo Group
as system admin trainee I encountered
.I OpenVMS
which I really could not quite understand.  Especially the
.I DECNet
was something that I struggled, but apparently I made good impression to
my boss as I got some responsibilities to do
.I Digital unix
work.  I also did some
.I microsoft windows
support, and this has been the last time I've done that during work
hours.
.\" Well, I still help my parents occasionally, when they have windows
.\" problems, but that's different thing).
