.SS "GNU Hello"
After sending few patches to
.I GNU Hello
the maintainer asked would I like to the project.  I was ok with that, so
now I am a official
.IR "GNU project maintainer" .
While I never intented to do this I'm sort of proud I got the privileged
to have honor to be trusted with this status.
